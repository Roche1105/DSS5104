Basic Check: 
1. No Missing Value
2. Unique Values Check: 
    column 'country' only USA; 
    column 'view' value from 0-4
    column 'condition' value from 1-5
    column 'waterfront' value 0 or 1
    column 'city' covers 44 different cities in Washington state
    column 'statezip' covers 77 different zip code in Washington
3. Drop unnecessary columns: date, counrty

EDA
1. Distribution(skewness) Check:
    a.  Wide Ranges / Different Magnitudes
        •	Features like price, sqft_lot, and sqft_living span large ranges.
        •	Solution: Use scaling (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) so that no single feature dominates due to its magnitude.
	b.	Skewed Distributions
        •	Features like price, sqft_lot, sqft_basement are right-skewed.
        •	Solution: Apply log transformation or Box-Cox to normalize them and improve model performance.
	c.	Spikes at Zero
        •	Features like sqft_basement, yr_renovated, and waterfront spike at 0.
        •	Solution: Create binary indicator columns
2. Correlation Check:
    •	Most features affect price positively with sqft_living showing the strongest positive relationship
    •	Only "yr_renovated" shows a negative relationship with price
    •	From correlation matrix plot, top 6 features are sqft_living, sqft_above, bathrooms, view, sqft_basement, bedrooms; but the top 2 are highly correlated
    •	There seems to be a slight relationship between price and most of the categorical variables
3. Visualization on geospacial data
    Maybe consider create a numerical variable to capture this feature; maybe not, since the correlation matrix shows no significant relationship with price


Feature Engineering
1. Outliers: price = 0, 3 extreme values, 50% duplicated rows
2. Categorical Variables:
    •	zero value in sqft_basement could indicate the absence of a basement, which shows it can explain physically. And at the same time, indicator variable can avoid multiple covariance.
    •	for yr_renovated, it could mean that a house was not renovated.
3. Geospatial Variables:
    a. [regions]According to Wikipedia, the first digit of a zip code represents the state ('9' corresponds to Washington), the second and third digits represent the region (or perhaps a large city) while the last two digits represent the the area of the city(for metropolitan areas) or a village/town (outside metro areas).
        •	'80':'1','81':'2','82':'3','83':'4'
        •	80 — Central/Eastern Colorado (Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins)
        •	81 — Western/Southern Colorado (Durango, Grand Junction)
        •	82 — All of Nebraska (Omaha, Lincoln, Kearney)
        •	83 — Both Dakotas (Bismarck, Fargo, Sioux Falls)
    b. [quadrant]Washington use quadrants to divide their street grid. These quadrants can be very meaningful. eg:NW — Northwest
    c. [road_type]
        •	'Rd': ['Rd', 'Road'],
        •	'Way': ['Way'],
        •	'St': ['St', 'Street'],
        •	'Ave': ['Ave', 'Avenue'],
        •	'Blvd': ['Blvd', 'Boulevard'],
        •	'Ln': ['Ln', 'Lane'],
        •	'Dr': ['Dr', 'Drive'],
        •	'Pl': ['Pl', 'Place'],
        •	'Ct': ['Ct', 'Court'],
        •	'Pkwy': ['Pkwy', 'Parkway'],
        •	'Hwy': ['Hwy'],
        •	'Terrace': ['Terrace'],
        •	'Trail': ['Trail'],
        •	'Cir': ['Cir'],
        •	'Walk': ['Walk'],
        •	'Key': ['Key']
4. Variables based on reality:
    ['total_rooms'],['total_space'],['totspace/room'],['facilities'],['score']
5. Encoding Variables
    a. Ordinal Encoding[waterfront, has_basement, was_renovated]
    b. One-hot encoding[view, condition, region, quadrant]
    c. Target Encoding[city, zip, road_type]: specifically, it calculates and encodes the mean value of these two variables for each categorical level

Output: 'house_dataset_processed'
